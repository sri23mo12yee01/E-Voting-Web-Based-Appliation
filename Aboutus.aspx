<p>Elections in India are events involving political mobilisation and organisational 
complexity on an amazing scale. In the 2004 election to Lok Sabha there were 1351 candidates
 from 6 National parties, 801 candidates from 36 State parties, 898 candidates fromofficially 
 recognised parties and 2385 Independent candidates.</p>
 <p>The Election Commission of India is an autonomous constitutional authority responsible for
     administering election processes to Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, state legislatures and the offices of the President
      and Vice President in India.</p><p> 
    Election Commission operates under the authority of Constitution, and subsequently enacted Representation of
     the People Act.</p>
    <p>The Supreme Court of India has held that where the enacted laws are silent or make insufficient
     provision to deal with a given situation in the conduct of elections, the Election Commission has the residuary 
     powers under the Constitution to act in an appropriate manner.</p>
